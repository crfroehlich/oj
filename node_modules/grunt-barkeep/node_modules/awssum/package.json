This means that the complex signatures have been done, but not all\noperations have been implemented:\n\n* AWS:\n    * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n\nIn future releases we will be targeting (in no particular order):\n\n* AWS:\n    * Relational Database Service (RDS) ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n    * Flexible Payments Service (FPS) ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n* RackspaceCloud:\n    * Servers (In Progress)\n    * Files (In Progress)\n    * LoadBalances (In Progress)\n    * DNS (In Progress)\n* Flickr ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n* PayPal ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n* Xero ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n* some Google services ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n* URL shorteners ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n* anything else you'd like? ([Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor])\n\nThere are lots of services out there, so please [Request or Sponsor Development][sponsor] if you'd like one\nimplemented.\n\n# What 'node-awssum' is? #\n\nnode-awssum is an abstraction layer to many web service APIs. It abstracts out the service endpoints, the HTTP verbs to\nuse, what headers and parameters to set, how to sign the request and finally how to decode the result. It let's you\npass a data structure in and get a data structure out. It also helps in the odd small way when dealing with complex\ninput such as creating XML (e.g. Amazon S3), JSON data structures (e.g. Amazon SQS) or parameters with lots of values\n(e.g. Amazon SimpleDB).\n\nIn saying this, there are some web service operations that are inherently nasty and since node-awssum is essentially a\nproxy to the operation itself it can't abstract away all nastiness.\n\nFor an example of where node-awssum helps is when creating a Bucket in Amazon S3. We take a single 'LocationConstraint'\nparameter in the 'createBucket' call and node-awssum takes that and builds (the horrible) XML which it needs to send\nwith the request. This makes it much easier to perform calls to the various web services and their individual\noperations since this simple notion is across all web services.\n\nHowever, there are also examples of where node-awssum can't really help make the operation nicer. Many of the Amazon\nWeb Services return XML which we blindly convert to a data structure and return that to the caller. In these cases we\ndon't perform any kind of manipulation or conversion to a canonical structure to make the returned data nicer. In these\ncases, a small library which sits on top of node-awssums libraries may be a good choice (see *winston-simpledb* for an\nexample of this - http://github.com/appsattic/winston-simpledb). This would be especially true for SimpleDB where the\nhigher level library could perform number padding, date conversions, creation of multi-field indexes and default field\nvalues - none of which node-awssum does.\n\n# Examples #\n\nExample 1. This is what node-awssum looks like when adding a topic to Amazon's Simple Notification Service:\n\n``` js\nsns.CreateTopic({ TopicName : 'my-topic' })\n=>  {\n        CreateTopicResponse:\n        {\n            '@': {\n                xmlns: 'http://sns.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-03-31/'\n            },\n            CreateTopicResult: {\n                TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:616781752028:my-topic'\n            },\n            ResponseMetadata: {\n                RequestId: '0928273f-fc34-11e0-945d-17a52825d3d9'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nWhat you would probably like to do is the following (with an example SNS Wrapper Library):\n\n``` js\nsnsWrapperLibrary.createTopic('my-topic')\n=>  arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:616781752028:my-topic\n```\n\nThis is pretty easy to do but annoying to have to find and extract the information you really want. node-awssum comes\nwith some example libraries. :)\n\nExample 2. Saving some attributes for AWS SimpleDB.\n\n...\n\n# What is 'node-awssum' for? #\n\nThis library has a number of uses but mostly it should be used from within a more friendly wrapper library. Let's look\nat some examples.\n\nExample 1: A SimpleDB Wrapper library. Since node-awssum doesn't do any kind of conversion of the values you want to\nput into SimpleDB, it would make sense that you used a library which did those conversions for you, such as padding\ninteger values, normalising dates into an ISO string, setting defaults or helping with queries.\n\nExample 2: When using Amazon Route53, you sometimes have to do a request, manipulate what you got back and then send a\nnew bit of data. Instead a wrapper library around node-awssum which just helps you add or delete resource records would\nbe much easier to use.\n\nExample 3: A small wrapper around the Simple Queue Service means you could simply have some commands such as send(...),\nreceive() and delete() would make using the service a breeze.\n\nThe reason for this is because the data structures it receives, and more especially those it returns, are far too\ncomplicated for dealing with them in your main program. Therefore in general, a wrapper library around these simple\noperations would make each service easier to use.\n\n# How to use it #\n\nThis library provides basic client functionality to each of these services. It's pretty simple but this means it's also\nquite powerful. In general you wouldn't use these libraries directly (though there is nothing stopping you making the\nodd call here and there, especially when setting your environment up) but instead you would use them via a more\nfriendly API via a wrapper library.\n\nYou can use this library in your programs and applications, but it can also be built on for more\nuser-friendly (from the perspective of the programmer) wrapper libraries.\n\nEssentially it's a \"data in, data out\" kinda library without too many bells and whistles. It doesn't really check what\nyou pass it, apart from when a parameter is required. As I sa\n\nAs a quick example, to create a domain in AWS SimpleDB:\n\n``` js\nvar awssum = require('awssum');\nvar amazon = awssum.load('amazon/amazon');\nvar sdbService = awssum.load('amazon/simpledb');\n\nvar sdb = new sdbService('key', 'secret', amazon.US_WEST_1);\n\nsdb.CreateDomain({ DomainName : 'test' }, function(err, data) {\n    console.log('Error :', err);\n    console.log('Data  :', data);\n});\n```\n\nA successful run outputs:\n\n``` js\nError : null\nData  : { ok: true }\n```\n\nA non-successful run results in a true error value, just like any other idiomatic NodeJS. :)\n\n[npm]: http://github.com/isaacs/npm\n[sponsor]: mailto:chilts%40appsattic.com\n\n# Author #\n\nWritten by [Andrew Chilton](http://www.chilts.org/blog/)\n\nCopyright 2011 [AppsAttic](http://www.appsattic.com/)\n\n# License #\n\nMIT.
